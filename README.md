# WatchWave
WatchWave is a video-sharing platform, designed to allow users to upload, share, and view videos. The platform supports user-generated content, providing features such as video channels, subscriptions, likes, and comments. It utilizes Django's robust backend capabilities to handle video management, user interactions, and real-time notifications, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience. Perfect for anyone looking to create or extend a media-rich application.

Note that in order to maintain security issues, I put all the hosts, passwords, keys and other special and sensitive fields inside an .env file at the same level as the docker-compose.yml file and inside it I set all these fields. 

Also note that I added this .env file to Git Ignore. 

So, to start and use this project, create this file for yourself, but never share it.

Also, this project is Dockerized and you can use it in both normal and Docker modes.

I hope you have a good and very safe experience. :)
